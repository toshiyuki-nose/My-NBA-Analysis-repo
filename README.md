# My-NBA-Analysis-repo
This repository is a personal analysis project that uses the NBA's public Stats API (stats.nba.com) to obtain, analyze, and visualize player, team, and game data using Python.

I will collect data such as season-by-season stats, game logs, and advanced metrics,
and use pandas to process, visualize, and analyze data to analyze NBA trends and verify player evaluations.

In addition to analysis using Python, this project will also involve data management and SQL processing using Oracle Database, and statistical analysis using R.

I will design analytical and management tables in Oracle, perform aggregation, preprocessing, and validation using SQL,
and integrate the results with Python and R to build a data analysis workflow that is practical.

I also plan to gradually add analytical code, SQL scripts, R scripts, notebooks, and generated data,
developing it into a portfolio that can handle everything from data engineering to analysis and statistics.
